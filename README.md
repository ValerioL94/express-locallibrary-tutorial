# express-locallibrary-tutorial

Following <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Express_Nodejs/Tutorial_local_library_website">THIS</a> awesome MDN tutorial I recreated a local library using express.

While I tried to strictly follow the tutorial, I rewrote all the views using using ejs instead of pug.

Finally with the help of the package <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-ejs-layouts"> express-ejs-layouts</a> I added a common layout to every page to avoid redundancy.
